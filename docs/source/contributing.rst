Prerequisites
-------------

If you are not already familiar with Poetry_, this is a poetry project, so you'll need this!

Getting Setup
-------------

See the :code:`Makefile` for common commands, but for some basic setup:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Installs the package with all the extras
    make install

And you'll want to make sure you can run the tests and linters successfully:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Runs CI-level tests, with coverage reports
    make test lint
